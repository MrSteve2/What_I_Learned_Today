I have always been fascinated by how people learn (and unlearn) so nudged by this quote 
>“If you don’t look back at yourself and think, ‘Wow, how stupid I was a year ago,’ then you must not have learned much in the last year.” 
>I finally decided to start recording my learnings and reflections on learning. - Ray Dalio

I have decided to start recording what I'm learning, partly to help me learn/unlearn, partly to model for my kids (they never seem to pay attention to what I say, but they watch everything I do).

Context Matters (yet again).  Our team is good at criticizing each others ideas and iron sharpens iron.  And it also works with at least one outside team.  But when we met a team we only had a few interactions with to give them feedback, we should NOT have commented so heavily on their document as the result was no discussion at all.   Instead we should have made a copy of the document and then asked our questions during the meeting.  Then we could have gotten instant feedback on what they might be ready to hear and had more of a conversation.
