# What_I_Learned_Today
I have always been fascinated by how people learn (and unlearn) so nudged by this quote 
>“If you don’t look back at yourself and think, ‘Wow, how stupid I was a year ago,’ then you must not have learned much in the last year.” 
>I finally decided to start recording my learnings and reflections on learning. - Ray Dalio

I have decided to start recording what I'm learning, partly to help me learn/unlearn, partly to model for my kids (they never seem to pay attention to what I say, but they watch everything I do).
